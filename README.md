## Prerequisites
macOS
Homebrew installed
Step 1: Install PHP and Composer
Homebrew simplifies the installation of PHP and Composer. Run the following commands in your terminal:

bash
```
brew install php@8.1
brew link php@8.1 --force
brew install composer
````

Ensure you replace php@8.1 with the version of PHP required for your project.

Step 2: Install Project Dependencies
Clone your Laravel project repository and navigate into the project directory:

bash

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

```

Then, install the PHP dependencies:

bash
```
composer install
```

Step 3: Set Up Laravel Environment
Copy the .env.example file to create your .env file:
```
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate an application key:
bash
```
php artisan key:generate
```


Step 4: Database Setup
Ensure your .env file is configured with your database connection details. Then, run the migrations:

bash
```
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

Step 5: Running the Project
Start the Laravel development server:

```
php artisan serve
```
Your Laravel application should now be accessible at http://localhost:8000/api/docs.

Additional Dependencies
For any additional dependencies specific to your project (e.g., Redis, MySQL), you can generally find them on Homebrew:

bash

```
brew install mysql redis imagick gd libreoffice
```
Replace <dependency-name> with the actual names of your required services, such as mysql, redis, etc.


Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during setup, ensure:

Your PHP and Composer versions match the project's requirements.
All services required by your application are correctly installed and running.
Your .env file is correctly configured for your local environment.
For more detailed troubleshooting, consult the Laravel and Homebrew documentation or reach out to the project maintainers.
